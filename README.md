Not a fan of bits of the stack? Fork it, change it, and use `npx create-remix --template your/repo`! Make it your own.

## Fly Setup

1. [Install Fly](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/installing-flyctl/)

2. Sign up and log in to Fly

```sh
fly auth signup
```

## The Database

In development, it's better to use a local database, The easiest way to do this is using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started). To start your postgres database, first make sure you have docker running, then run the following command:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

That may take a moment to start up as it needs to get the postgres image from the Docker registry, after it's done, you'll need to migrate your database. With the database ready to accept connections, open a new tab and run this:

```sh
npx prisma migrate dev
```

When this finishes successfully, it will say:

> All migrations have been successfully applied.

Then seed the database using the following command

```sh
npx prisma db seed
```

When this finishes successfully, it will say:

> Database has been seeded. ðŸŒ±

If you'd prefer not to use Docker, you can also use Fly's Wireguard VPN to connect to a development database (or even your production database). You can find the instructions to set up Wireguard [here](https://fly.io/docs/reference/private-networking/#install-your-wireguard-app), and the instructions for creating a development database [here](https://fly.io/docs/reference/postgres/).

## Build

To run the production build for the app, run the following script:

```sh
npm run build
```

This should take less than a second âš¡

## Development

With your postgres database up and running in one tab and setup with tables for your data model via prisma, you're ready to start the dev server. Run this in a new tab in your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

This is a pretty simple note-taking app, but it's a good example of how you can build a full stack app with Prisma and Remix. The main functionality is creating users, logging in and out, and creating and deleting notes.

### Relevant code:

- creating users, and logging in and out [./app/models/user.server.ts](./app/models/user.server.ts)
- user sessions, and verifying them [./app/session.server.ts](./app/session.server.ts)
- creating, and deleting notes [./app/models/note.server.ts](./app/models/note.server.ts)

## Deployment

This Remix Stack comes with two GitHub actions that handle automatically deploying your app to production and staging environments.

Prior to your first deployment, you'll need to do a few thing:

- Create a new [GitHub Repository](https://repo.new)

- Create two apps on Fly, one for staging and one for production:

  ```sh
  fly create blues-stack-template
  fly create blues-stack-template-staging
  ```

- Make sure you have a `FLY_API_TOKEN` added to your GitHub repo, to do this, go to your user settings on Fly and create a new [token](https://web.fly.io/user/personal_access_tokens/new), then add it to [your repo secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) with the name `FLY_API_TOKEN`. Finally you'll need to add a `SESSION_SECRET` to your fly app secrets, to do this you can run the following commands:

  ```sh
  fly secrets set SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32) --app blues-stack-template
  fly secrets set SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32) --app blues-stack-template-staging
  ```

  If you don't have openssl installed, you can also use [1password](https://1password.com/generate-password) to generate a random secret, just replace `$(openssl rand -hex 32)` with the generated secret.

- Create a database for both your staging and production environments. Run the following:

  ```sh
  fly postgres create --name blues-stack-template-db
  fly postgres attach --postgres-app blues-stack-template-db --app blues-stack-template

  fly postgres create --name blues-stack-template-staging-db
  fly postgres attach --postgres-app blues-stack-template-staging-db --app blues-stack-template-staging
  ```

  Fly will take care of setting the DATABASE_URL secret for you.

Now that every is set up you can commit and push your changes to your repo. Every commit to your `main` branch will trigger a deployment to your production environment, and every commit to your `dev` branch will trigger a deployment to your staging environment.

### Multi-region deploys

Once you have your site and database running in a single region, you can add more regions by following [Fly's Scaling](https://fly.io/docs/reference/scaling/) and [Multi-region PostgreSQL](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/multi-region-databases/) docs.

Make certain to set a `PRIMARY_REGION` environment variable for your app. You can use `[env]` config in the `fly.toml` to set that to the region you want to use as the primary region for both your app and database.

#### Testing your app in other regions

Install the [ModHeader](https://modheader.com/) browser extension (or something similar) and use it to load your app with the header `fly-prefer-region` set to the region name you would like to test.

You can check the `x-fly-region` header on the response to know which region your request was handled by.

## GitHub Actions

We use GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. Anything that gets into the `main` branch will be deployed to production after running tests/build/etc. Anything in the `dev` branch will be deployed to staging.

## Testing

### Cypress

We use Cypress for our End-to-End tests in this project. You'll find those in the `cypress` directory. As you make changes, add to an existing file or create a new file in the `cypress/e2e` directory to test your changes.

We use [`@testing-library/cypress`](https://testing-library.com/cypress) for selecting elements on the page semantically.

To run these tests in development, run `npm run test:e2e:dev` which will start the dev server for the app as well as the Cypress client. Make sure the database is running in docker as described above.

We have a utility for testing authenticated features without having to go through the login flow:

```ts
cy.login();
// you are now logged in as a new user
```

We also have a utility to auto-delete the user at the end of your test. Just make sure to add this in each test file:

```ts
afterEach(() => {
  cy.cleanupUser();
});
```

That way, we can keep your local db clean and keep your tests isolated from one another.

### Vitest

For lower level tests of utilities and individual components, we use `vitest`. We have DOM-specific assertion helpers via [`@testing-library/jest-dom`](https://testing-library.com/jest-dom).

### Type Checking

This project uses TypeScript. It's recommended to get TypeScript set up for your editor to get a really great in-editor experience with type checking and auto-complete. To run type checking across the whole project, run `npm run typecheck`.

### Linting

This project uses ESLint for linting. That is configured in `.eslintrc.js`.

### Formatting

We use [prettier](https://prettier.io/) for auto-formatting in this project. It's recommended to install an editor plugin (like the [VSCode prettier plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)) to get auto-formatting on save. There's also a `npm run format` script you can run to format all files in the project.
